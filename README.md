# What is KDE and the "K Programming Language?"

KDE is the K Language DE, the IDE used to program in K, a low level language like C.

# Is K Compiled?

Yes, K is a compiled language like C. the KDE features a Emulation feature that will compile the language into a small .temp file and run it from there. K compiles to K256 Assembly.

# Why program in K and not the Assembly Language?

Well, unless you like typing in binary, KDE features Compile to MCSchematic so you can easily paste your program into the K256 SOC, and also features emulation to test programs along with a Sprite Editor to draw sprites and coding assistance. If you are up for a chanllenge, sure, you could build the game card by hand and code it by hand.

# How can I install the KDE?

Installing KDE is simple, there is a exe installer (don't worry it's programmed in Python, just compressed) that you can download and use to install KDE, as KDE will do everything on it's own.

# How do I program in KDE?

Learning to program in K is like programming in C, but closer to the langauge Lua. I have made a series on how to program in K you can check out on Google Sites that will teach you how to use KDE and how to program 2 games, simple, and a little tricky.
